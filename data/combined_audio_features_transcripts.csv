Until recent years, when I came to America, after New York, after finished Echewis, and I realized that I was running out of time because I was running wild when I was on the move. I felt unworthy to be an actor. I felt unworthy of success. I felt massive guilt about it. I don't know what. Until gradually, it was sort of explained to me through other people, by other people and through. I think a voice inside myself saying, there's nothing to fear, you know, live and accept life, accept the good in life, and don't be so guilty. There's nothing to be guilty about. There's nothing to be frightened of. And what I've come around to understanding is, that I have a faith in God, which I didn't have before. I was too clever. And now I'm not clever anymore. I try to keep out of my own way, you know, as much as I can. Which has given me a sort of peace of mind, I mean, you know, and I get uptight, but it's all I know that there's no big deal anymore.

It had won the Governor General's Award in Canada for children's literature. It was cited as a work of genius and it is. It's brilliant. And it captures perfectly the life of an adolescent. And particularly an adolescent who's suddenly without a father, whose father has died in a shipping accident. Well, no. It was short period in the Second World War. And it's set in 1952 and a man who is present a pirate, who is present at the very beginning of the film in 1717 and who, like the flying Dutchman, travels the world. He breaked his havoc, created his justice in that town in 1717 and then came back 200 years later in 1952.",-316.903564453125,116.11349487304688,33.1718864440918,17.081228256225586,22.23318099975586,10.58497428894043,-6.413301944732666,-2.6455018520355225,0.3686984777450561,2.5144073963165283,0.2795312404632568,4.855584621429443,8.19481372833252,76.98072052001953,38.67333221435547,19.03846549987793,16.818513870239258,15.031183242797852,12.60747241973877,12.480435371398926,10.417011260986328,9.544705390930176,9.072953224182127,9.006793975830078,8.217368125915527,6.995537757873535,1278.198484454903,1723.9894459807128,2725.7561383928573,0.0671182686941964,non-dementia

I got my hands on it, while I made a movie cameras that my uncles had, and was always horsing around with it, idly.

And I think none of us initially, we were really thinking seriously that we were starting to build a career, or build a business out of it. And a couple of years later, we set up, in fact, the company to do commercials in industrial films, and like that, here in Pittsburgh. And because this is a big corporate market, we got some jobs. There were advertising agencies here, and it was kind of being in the right place at the right time.

Of course there are things that are outdated, like kings and queens, but there are presidents who do have power and there are tyrants and Shakespeare's very, very interested in people who have power and he wants to tell you what they really like and what a dangerous thing it is to have too much power. And King Lear is such a man. He's a very foolish man. He says it of himself. He does some, makes some silly mistakes. He's not a cruel man. I mean, he doesn't kill people as far as we can see. But he doesn't know how to deal with his daughters. So we don't hear about him. And Mrs. Lear, but people can see this and say, you are exactly like my granddad when he was dying. He went a bit dotty too. Or some came along and American said, well, it's all about Trump, isn't it? I don't get that at all, but an audience brings to it their own life. And they measure their own experience, a family experience or of politics, whatever it happens to, whatever their interest is and match it against the experience of the characters that they're seeing act out their story.

And somehow in the 70s, that decade we were able to make pictures. People weren't talking about how much picture was making. I mean, at a certain point, yes, how much money would make or how much they would be able to risk. But primarily, they were talking about the new Terry Malik picture or the new poll-traded picture or that sort of new Francis Coppola film. These were films that were like, they were proud to make in a way. They were proud to underwrite, I think, film makers with, and I don't want to use it because it could become a dirty word, but vision, a vision, meaning that they have a way of telling the story, to give them as much control.

It was a complete mess. Everything was really over at that point. But it wasn't easy to get the films made in the 70s, but there was an atmosphere of making special movies of Robert Altman picture.

So it was a long time since we had worked together. And we tried to find all these other projects, remakes of the bad and the beautiful. Remember the story about Hollywood and Kurt Douglas? All that sort of thing. And finally, it came down to a situation where we decided that we were going to make a film about an aging hitman, supposedly. And we were working on this one project. But it was kind of a genre piece. And I don't know how to do genre anymore. And the genre that I know goes back to 1948. It doesn't, doesn't pay. So Eric gave him this book, supposedly, the memoirs of a hitman, so to speak. Yeah. And Bob came to talk to me about the character. And as he was talking about the character, he became rather emotional about it. And I said, that's something. Now, if we are going to go back into that milieu, which we were associated with in Casino and Goodfellas, then this is something that maybe we could learn a little more about ourselves and go deeper.

And also, is there any tracks that you didn't release at the time? And can you do something special? And I said, no, there's no tracks. There's nothing. There's nothing. It's all done.

So I went in and Keith and I looked and I looked with Don was a producer and we looked at all these tracks. And some of them were sent by people that thought they were like stone's experts. And I looked and I said, this does not sound like so. So some of them were not in the time of X-R at all.

It was a character who was on the edge. And then due to his relationship with Danny or to this new relationship with the new partner, it all starts to come back. The thing that wasn't there, that I really attribute to Mel and Danny and that is their ability to relate on a level with a sense of humor. We developed that sense of humor. And a lot of it was improvisational. The entire scene in the car when they're driving away, which I desperately love when they, after Dan Mel has jumped off the building with a guy and he's attempted suicide, we thought, and Danny finds out from the psychiatrist that he's in trouble. And they start that scene in the car. And we drove pulling that car, and I was on the outside of the van listening. And these two guys just all start to flow. That's when it really happened between the relationship with the two. We were in hysterics on the car. That to me is the only difference in this picture makes him a lot of pictures.

So right now, this time, I only have about four things really in process in development that are fundamentally written and are being polished. I don't have a list of 40 or 50 subjects. When I first started, I didn't know what to do other than the fact I knew I wanted to make a film. I couldn't get a camera until I wrote a script, which is the best lure in the world. You want that ball-X, which is a clock-white camera, you're right, the screenplay. So that moment was into James Joyce and particularly Eulaceys with all his descriptive, wonderful descriptive passages. And so for the moment, I became James Joyce for a couple of months.

The newspaper can create great controversies, stir up arguments within the community to discussion, can throw light on injustices, just as it can do the opposite, can hide things and be a great path or evil.

This is the freedom of the press that is needed. The freedom of the press must not be one side, just for a public hitter to speak as he plays us.

I think now I've gotten to the point where when I see myself, I really don't see myself. I see the character and I look rather objectively at that. I think that most of the time that that's what happens to me. For example, in the blue and the gray when I saw it, I was really caught up in the story. I didn't really take time to objectify myself and say, oh, I don't look so good in that shot or I do it. But when I started out in this business, that's all I was preoccupied with. I would go to Daly's and look at every detail of the...

I went in junior high school and in high school. But my family, my father particularly was, he was very much, he was dead set against either my brother or myself going into the business. He loved it and he had been successful in it, but he just felt that it was not something that was secure, it was full of disappointment, full of rejection, and that he was concerned. He wanted financial and emotional security for his kids, so he, they didn't support it, you know. Until I suddenly, I landed in the ninth grade, the part of the stage manager in our town.

Peter Morgan, I think, first of all, is a wonderful political portrait artist. I think his depiction of Queen Elizabeth and Queen and Edie Amin and the last King of Scotland were extraordinary character studies. I've never met Peter, but I'd be fascinated to ask him what compelled him to become so fascinated with Richard Nixon, because I think in many ways what he does with his interpretation, in many ways rehabilitates Nixon's image probably more than the original Frost Nixon, he just did themselves. I think that he has a very sympathetic approach to Nixon's character. In one respect, I found he, he, he, he, he, amuse him with humor.

And then finally, after two cycles of that, it's going to rain and you're back in the Mono loop coming out of both channels. And then all of a sudden you hear a change in quality. What is it? It goes into stereo. It goes into, and you feel that. It's like something weird is happening. Now for those of you who know, you know exactly what it is that's happening. And then what's happened is that slowly, I think it's a left hand side, begins to go faster. Now why? Well, maybe the loop I tried to cut the loops is perfectly as I can, but you know what does that mean? There's going to be some little fractional difference between them, right?

It's been about prejudice, about fear, about those sorts of things, attacking one another very, very negative campaigns. But once again, by two leaders that I had no real support for, I thought the two leaders that should have been there were Rudd and Turnbull, and that would have been a genuine choice for the voters. I mean, I think Gillard is an accident, and I think Tony Abbott got there when the Liberal Party split. He won, he got the leadership by one vote, 43, 42. God knows how it happened, but I would say that if Turnbull had been the leader, that would have been no contest. He would have absolutely given Gillard a bath in this",-357.5072631835937,98.11570739746094,2.114519596099853,37.41859817504883,4.018619060516357,-4.422942161560059,-12.713586807250977,-1.6975730657577517,-2.2310903072357178,-5.092226505279541,-7.244648933410644,-4.515862464904785,-7.977700710296631,100.97589111328124,54.00876998901367,27.305234909057617,28.214906692504883,17.803733825683594,14.03101921081543,13.755148887634276,13.80119800567627,12.9400634765625,13.77483367919922,13.374680519104004,10.996594429016112,10.49880599975586,1615.0387016003365,1562.3486960208756,3143.379080118694,0.1238150848479228,dementia

He and I decided that we really didn't want to stay in the animation business forever. I didn't want to be writing for a move when I was 45 years old, and Chris, who was 10 years older than I, sure didn't want to do it anymore. So we began trying our hand at freelance stuff, and why we were still working for J. And we came up with an idea to do a series about a family of sort of weird offbeat characters that were loosely based in our minds on the Charles Adams cartoons, and it used to be in the New York, or the very strange looking husband and wife, and look like Peter Laurie and the Empire.

One is that he is, of course, the inheritor of a great tradition of visual arts in Japan, and perhaps somewhat more concerned than a number of other Japanese filmmakers with perpetuating that, which in a sense making it enter into modern cinema. The other thing is that he's an extraordinary film writer and script writer with a propensity for adaptations of canonical texts. One of those, for example, is the idea of just the F.C. Another is, in fact, Desuazou Sala, which is a canonical text of a very particular kind in Russia, and we'll talk about that perhaps a bit later.

They wanted an actress over 18, because they didn't want her to have to go to school on the set, because the role of Liesel was larger than that of the other children, and they didn't want to lose that time every day.

And I didn't know about the sound of music. I had never seen the play. And I hadn't really been clamoring to be an actress. I was working and going to college and saving money to travel. And I met with the casting director, and he had me come back the next day and read the 16 going on 17 scene, which I did. And then he caught me back again, and I met the director and read the scene for him. And then I had to come back the next day to sing 16 going on 17. And my mother and father both sang.

I said he was doing this film, a clockwork orange, and asked me if I would go up to this house in I think it was in Reblet up in North London. And we filmed this terrible movie. It was quite strange actually, because I mean, the first scene I did, I was doing nothing else, but carrying Alex, who was Malcolm McDowell, down the stairs. And I did it all day, like, non-stop. And at the end of the day, I could hardly move, I could hardly move my arms. And then Stanley turned around to me. He said, to the next day, he said, we're going to do this thing where you can carry Patrick McGee down the stairs in his wheelchair. I said, hang on a minute. I said, oh, I said, you know, I said, you know, I said, you know, one take Kubrick, you know? And he said, all we do is quick as we can, you know? And we shot the scene in about three or four takes. He was a hard taskmaster to work for, but a lovely guy. I loved him. I got him very, very well with him. And then of course, you know, that came out in 1971, I think it was. And luckily for me, George Lucas saw it, because it was out very, very briefly, because it was, it created a lot of bad publicity and over the content of the film. And anyway, I said, Lucas saw it in the very brief period that it was out. And I remember me for five years and then came to London and set himself up in the 20th Century Fox offices in London, Central London. And got in touch with the Managing Director and said, look, do me a favor. Can you find me this great day, you press? And then I got called in.

The next part of the story I heard I couldn't believe they said the Department of Defense is bringing them back to the East Coast, putting them down a Baltimore land and they're told from here you pay your home way home and by the way be back in two weeks and we get you back to Iraq. I didn't believe it and I had my staff check and it was true. I filed a bill about two weeks later to require the Department of Defense to pay the domestic travel and every time I file a new bill I do what's called a dear colleague letter and within 10 days two weeks I had 138 co-sponsors, Republicans and Democrats signed on this bill. I don't know what to note across the top of my dear colleague letter in blue, and it's a nervous present. I know you care about our troops, please make this happen in this morning. I was stuck in my pocket and we went over to the White House Christmas party and I saw a gun named Don Rumsville and I walked over to him and I said Mr. Secretary of Defense, I was born, I talked for a minute and I reached my pocket and he had a newsletter and he said what is this? I told him he said I said I would really appreciate if you could help me get this done for our troops and he said let me see what I can do and get back with you. He never combed me back, never wrote me back but two weeks after I talked to him he incorporated my bill into the Defense Department of Budget Retractor Act of September 1101 just like I'd written. It's now law and that really felt good and I had two in fact back home two members of the Army come up to me and thank me for doing the bill and they said you know I didn't even come back from Iraq because I knew I didn't have the money to get home.

The literature of the 1930s is a repeat with the examples of noise reduction systems that had been designed. And that activity carried on at least until the outbreak of the Second World War. Everyone was hoping for some way of reducing noise. And no one had succeeded. The cure always seemed to be worse than the disease. And naturally I was fascinated by this problem. I had been working at Ampex and the problem of noise was well known and understood by the engineers working in that field. My recognition that the noise is really very, very small in comparison with the loudest signal that one deals with in sound recording. The professional recorders at that time had signal to noise ratio of nominally 60 decibels. That's a voltage ratio of a thousand to one. In other words, for a maximum signal height of this much, the noise is extremely small, one tenth of one percent.

And at that time, in 1967, those British people reasonably well informed about Canada and some were, and those Americans who were the same. And I'm talking to them about people who had no bad feelings, no hostile feelings toward Canada, took for granted that Canada would disappear from the map within a few years. The guessing was that Canada, which would have gone halfway toward becoming a country, we were still a colony, it's often forgotten after the Confederation, we were still a colony. But we would go all the way to being independent and become a country and then realize that it did make no sense because all the power, all the wealth, all the population was in the United States. And all the lines, natural lines of geography and communication, transportation, finance and so on, went north south. And they wanted us. They wanted us, of course they did, they wanted, it was manifest, they wanted us to stretch up to the pole. And two things stopped them. One was the very curious heart to understand objectively, cold bloodedly, choice of Canadians not to become Americans. They just didn't want to become Americans. The second one was this guy, John E. McDonald. By some fluke, we were very lucky. We were a runny little backward provincial colony on the edge of civilization. That's all we were in 1867, but then nothing more. We had in John E. McDonald, what I honestly and I've looked at things with some care, I would put him in the absolute top class of all national leaders in democracies. That is, I would put him up there with Benjamin Disraeli, the British Prime Minister and Abraham Lincoln, of course, the great American president of his time. Best of his time. He was just uncanny that's such an able politician. And he was, he was extraordinary, I can tell you, he said, giving examples of his ability to understand what was really going on, then figure out how to manipulate the politician into doing what he thought was necessary. And what he thought was always necessary was to build Canada. Well, you've compared him to other leaders of other democracies. And let's just, let's figure out how much democracy we actually had going on in the country at the time, because remember Canada is a country of three and a half million people at the time. Basically one city. And it's not the city we're in now, it's Montreal, Toronto's 60,000 people. Your Toronto was quite small. How much democracy do we have in Canada at the time? At the time, well, actually only about 20% of people had to vote. No women to start with, no native people, no aboriginals to add to that. And then anybody who didn't own property, and you had to own a minimum amount of property, the theory being that those people who had property had a house to protect, whatever farm.",-318.8489685058594,87.82075500488281,16.014976501464844,9.57336139678955,-4.213192462921143,-1.277307629585266,-18.429370880126957,-3.6061272621154794,-9.85878562927246,-7.689138889312744,-1.435929775238037,-11.030163764953612,-10.260080337524414,89.77408599853516,43.22958755493164,29.144508361816406,25.658662796020508,23.664403915405277,15.39000129699707,16.84005355834961,14.923909187316896,14.480344772338867,12.994348526000977,12.177610397338867,10.59766960144043,10.94074535369873,1656.9099471391987,1720.9122565544865,3315.286761801304,0.1121911763344361,dementia

Ingrid did it, many famous people did it, but Deborah set the mark on that play. And this was really serendipity because I lived in the garden department of the people who owned the theater guild. I was my first wife and I lived there. And I, as I said, used to write about eight shows and I was working on a play and I didn't want to write the next show that they wanted me to write. And it was a show called Remember the Day, a play by Philip. I forgot. Anyway, I didn't like the play particularly. And Al Mino Marshall, who was Mrs. Liner, came down and begged me to do it. And I said, Al Mino, I really don't like the play and I'm busy on something else. And she said, well, we'll have the apartment painted for you if you do it. And I said, Al Mino, please, please don't bribe me like that. And then we had a garden outside, which being the garden department, we had the garden. And she said, she went out and looked at it. She said, do you know the walls all need painting? And I said, Al Mino, I really just don't like the play. I finally did it and I met Deborah Carr on that show. Just accident. And I said to her at the end, she was on her way to Hollywood. She hadn't even met the Hollywood yet. All the theaters and movies out there, wonderful early movies.

That was his whole role during World War II dealing with Montgomery, Churchill, oh my god, Patton. But he's also a kind of a quiet strength too.

And I think that what Duke felt was what I felt at the time and that is the great immorality of the Vietnam War was for our government to be asking young men to give up their lives in that war when the government had no intention of winning it because they were afraid of what might follow that might be worse if we tried to win that particular war. And as I say, I think that was the great immorality. I think Duke felt the same. When he made a green beret, there was something more going on in Hollywood at that time than just whether people weren't in favor of the war. I remember that we'd call the theater when the picture first opened, it opened to reserve seats like a play would be. And Nancy and I couldn't get tickets to it. And we'd call the box office and say, has anyone turned in their tickets or anything that we could and we couldn't? And finally, we called someone else that was supposed to be in charge of the tickets and found out that there were tickets for any night you wanted them.

Homer Rice was the athletic director then, and Homer called me one day in Greensboro and said, what do you have about driving down tomorrow and have lunch with me? I'd like to talk to you about our games. And to be a nice guy, I said, yeah, I'd like to do that. So I did, and it was really interesting, because the next day when I walked into his office, and I have a pretty good idea, Susan Strobel, who was the administrative assistant to the athletic director for a number of years, first Chuck Erickson, then Coach Rab, and finally Homer Rice, and she also worked for John Swapardson before she retired. And I'd known Susan, and Susan knew I went to school at Carolina. And I think she probably told Homer why didn't he give me a call. And so when I walked in the office, and he got up to shake my hand and welcomed me, he said, I found out something interesting about you yesterday, and I said, really what's that? He said, I found out you went to school here. And I laughed, and I said, well, Homer, if I've been doing ACC basketball with Jim Thacker and Bones McKenney for four years on ACC television, and you didn't know it all yesterday, that I went to school here, and I've been doing a heck of a job, staying neutral. And we had a good laugh on it. But then I got interested in it, and decided I'd try to get it. And Bill Dooley was a football coach in, and Coach Smith was a basketball coach, and he had been named head coach while I was in school in the summer of 1961. And I called him both, and I said, if I try to go for this, would you give me your support? And they both said they would, and they did. And so that's how it all got started.",-474.9240112304688,115.61685943603516,9.863981246948242,11.520316123962402,-9.075175285339355,-13.36834716796875,-12.867108345031738,-21.694744110107425,-8.834419250488281,-1.1087265014648438,-9.99894905090332,-3.84019136428833,-6.513548374176025,82.16915130615234,50.88917541503906,34.28068161010742,24.917688369750977,23.514453887939453,16.54570960998535,13.75960922241211,17.280946731567383,11.823935508728027,11.599452018737791,10.687699317932127,8.251082420349121,7.908363342285156,1108.8041023639394,1119.1348226644816,2036.0746298608635,0.0891972955873171,dementia
